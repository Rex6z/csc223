# Time and Space Complexity
* Time complexity: The running time of a program as a function of the input size
* Space complexity: The about of computer memory that is required during a program's execution as a function of the input size
    * Fixed part: Space needed to store the instructions, constants, variables, and structured variables
    * Variable part: Space needed for recursion stack and structured variables that are allocated space dynamically during the runtime of a program

# Big O Notation
* Dominant factor in an expresion used to determine the order of magnitude of the result
* Expressed as O(n)
* If algorithm preforms n^2 operations to sort n elemetns, the algorithm would be described as O(n^2)
* Constant multipliers are ignored
    * O(4n) becomes O(n)
* Only take the highest power
* Dependant on programming language used, compiler/interpreter quality, CPU speed, main memory size and access time, programmer knowledge, and the algorithm
* Strict upper bound; can do better but not worse than specified value

### Examples
* 4n^2 = O(n^3)
* 400n^3 + 20n^2 = O(n^3)
* n = O(n log n)
* 10n^3 + 20n != O(n^2)

# Omega Notation (Ω)
* Lower bound; function can only do worse, not better
* Examples
    * 5n^2 + 10n = Ω(n^2)
    * 7n != Ω(n^2)

# Theta Notation (Θ)
* Kind of confusing, don't really understand

# Other Useful Notations
* Also confusing
